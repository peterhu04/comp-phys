Need to make sure dont skip over POI in integration, just do two sep integrals split down center of POI

Gaussain quadrature for more accurate integration, can look it up

Chebyshev Polynomials
- Tn = cos(nacos(x)), -1 <= x <= 1
- in general do not evaluate the polynomials, much better to eval by using recursive relationship
- very common to use insreawd of taylow because taylor gets bad away from center.


ODEs
- factor of 2 work -> factor of 2 inc in error.
  - improve by being smarter in calculations, cancel higher order terms in taylor
- 
- use runge kutta
  - rk2 mit
- rk4: better in most ways probably
  -

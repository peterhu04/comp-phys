Need to make sure dont skip over POI in integration, just do two sep integrals split down center of POI

Gaussain quadrature for more accurate integration, can look it up

Chebyshev Polynomials
- Tn = cos(nacos(x)), -1 <= x <= 1
- in general do not evaluate the polynomials, much better to eval by using recursive relationship
- very common to use insreawd of taylow because taylor gets bad away from center.
